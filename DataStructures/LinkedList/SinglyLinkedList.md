# Singly Linked List
 
A linked list is a way to store a collection of elements. Like an array these can be character or integers. Each element in a linked list is stored in the form of a node.

# Node:

A node is a collection of two sub-elements or parts. A data part that stores the element and a next part that stores the link to the next node.

# Linked List:

A linked list is formed when many such nodes are linked together to form a chain. Each node points to the next node present in the order. The first node is always used as a reference to traverse the list and is called HEAD. The last node points to NULL.
